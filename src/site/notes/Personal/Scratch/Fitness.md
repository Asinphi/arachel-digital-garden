# General Tips

## What to bring
Bring a water model, headphones for music, and phone
Wear shorts/sweatpants and shirt of breathable fabric

## Workout schedule
Start with 5 minutes of cardio to loosen muscles; 2 minutes medium, 2 minutes hard, 1 minute easy.

After cardio warm-up, can go to stretching, then strength (resistance) training, finish off with core training (targets back and abs) like minute-long plank hold or various abs exercises (sit-ups, crunches), and then cooldown stretching (spend a good 5 minutes)
## Sets and reps
Good place to start is 3 sets of 12 reps for each exercise; find a weight for which I can do 12 reps, with the 12th rep being a little hard to complete. Between sets, take a minute or less to rest.
Most sets should be done between 6 and 12 rep range. Some sets can be done in 1-5 rep range (low range) or 12-20 rep range (high range). Can be beneficial to train big compound lifts with heavy weights in low range. High rep range can be beneficial for isolation exercises (e.g. bicep curls, tricep extensions, lateral raises, leg extensions, and cable flies) because heavier weights might result in poor technique/joint pain.

Do most sets 0-3 reps away from failure.

Number of sets should be just enough to stop being sore just in time for next session. Reduce volumes if it doesn't stop being sore by next session.

Training to failure should be reserved to the last set of the last exercise for that body part, and should be saved for isolation movements, not compound, and for machine exercises or ones that don't run a safety risk if you fail.
One way to prioritize an exercise/body part is do it earlier in your workout, where you're stronger, and make sure it doesn't follow a heavy workout day.

Supersets are back-to-back exercises in one set; they're good when the exercises are opposing muscle groups to make the workout more efficient by cutting down on time spent resting.

Minimalism:
Doing 1-4 sets per muscle group per week will get on average, 64% of the total potential gain.
People are able to maintain their existing gains for 8 months by doing as little as 1/9th of their previous volume.
If doing minimalism, though, take most sets to failure. Or dropset; extend set past failure by dropping the weight back 25-50% and taking that to failure.

## Rep tempo
Concentric (positive) movement is pushing/pulling weight, Eccentric movement (negative) is returning to starting position
Repetition tempo between 2 seconds (e.g. 1 second concentric, one second eccentric) and 6 seconds (e.g. 3 seconds concentric, 3 seconds eccentric) is optimal for muscle growth, with closer to 2 seconds being slightly more favorable.
Use a concentric speed on the faster side (1-2 seconds) that minimizes momentum used and allows you to feel your muscles working throughout.
Perform eccentric movement so you're actively controlling weights against gravity, not simply dropping it
For squats and bench press, can perform concentric fast and explosive.

[New research shows that the concentric movement should be quick and explosive (while still minimizing momentum) but eccentric movement, the more important part, should be nice and slow, 2-4 seconds eccentric.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71op1DQ2gyo)

## Range of Motion
[New studies indicate that long-length partials are better than full range of motion and are better than short-length partials.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftpH4-xFGQI)
Long-length partials are going from from muscles fully stretched to half contracted (rather than fully contracted, which would be full range of motion) e.g. only doing the lower half of a bicep curl or only pulling the bar halfway to your chest on lat pulldowns.
One method to use long-length partials is extend the last set done for a muscle beyond the typical failure point (suitable for hams, back, pull-ups, rows). Don't do this for everything or there could be recovery issues.
Another method is do long-length partials for every single rep of a set on the last set of several exercises; might need to go heavier with partials to get close to failure (suitable for things like rows, DB flyes, smith machine press, and leg presses)
They can also be sprinkled in throughout the set rather than on the last set; they can be alternated with full range of motion reps
Make sure to keep form perfect and cut the range of motion short enough, like 50%

## Rest time
Resting >60 seconds (like 2-3 minutes) between sets is best for maximizing muscle growth. But you are only ready for your next set when you're not breathing heavily anymore, you feel strong again, and your synergist muscles are also good.
[Longer rest (3-5) minutes is better for compound exercises. Isolation exercises, 1-2 minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To2NIrc9QAM)
No downsides to resting longer than usual.

Gradually reducing rest time over time can still maximize effect, like reduce it by 15 seconds each week from 2 minutes to 1 minute.

## Weekly program
10-16 sets per muscle group per week is a good place to start; compound sets are technically a fraction of a set for each muscle group involved.
I've also heard [9-12](https://youtu.be/OlbTpxdnMCI?si=J4dDQKtu4g84fX_u&t=1172) from another video; smaller muscle groups like triceps, biceps, quads, and rear delts only need 3-6 sets per week because of use in compound exercises.
Now I'm hearing [6 working sets per muscle group per week is basically optimal](https://youtu.be/cfXTQmFRjWU?si=dSyBauwOrazAxX_f&t=318).

Try to balance your physique, don't focus on specific muscle groups too much or you'll get an unbalanced physique during the newbie period, which is the period of best gains.

Distribute sets between 1-3 workouts per week.

Should have at least 2 rest days spread between workout days. Put the workout where you work on your priority muscles after the longest sequence of rest days.

Progressive overload: increments in loads should be made 2.5-5% at a time

Some beginner mistakes are biting too much programming, inconsistency, avoiding free weights (free weights build technique), getting too close to failure at the expense of technique, and trying advanced programming (beginners advance better without it)
### Splits
It's not effective to focus one body part per day ("bro" split) because there's an upper limit for gains in one day and it doesn't need a full week to recover. It's better to split those sets between days. After 2-3 days, you're not getting anything from the workout anymore so it's better to hit the workout again.

Could do sets for each body part twice/thrice a week, spread evenly, hit the gym about 4 days a week (upper/lower split)
Another option is full body twice a week, spread evenly (full body split), but would need to spend longer in the gym.
An intermediate/advanced split is the push-pull-legs split, where you dedicate one day to push, next to pull, next to legs, and repeat that over the next 3 days. You'd be in the gym for 6 days a week.

Full body each session, all muscle groups, is good for beginner because it generally has compound exercises and builds a solid foundation.

## Growing muscle: Progressive Overload
Beginners are those who are experiencing great gains on an almost linear level (gains in big compound strength of 5-10 lbs a month in the 5-10 rep range—60-120 lbs per year on bench); need to focus on technique and compound exercises. Intermediate gains begin to plateau and it's time to hit the gym at least 4 times a week and plan workouts more carefully. Advanced gains only come with meticulously planned training. Sometimes different muscle groups can be in different stages. 

For progress, the first thing to do is to add weight, but if adding weight causes you to miss reps, focus on gradually trying to reach the original number of reps with the new weight. If the number of reps you can do doesn't increase, add another set.

Best indicator of muscle growth isn't soreness or feeling, but increased strength; being able to lift increased weight. In the first few months of lifting, strength increases faster than muscle mass.

Choosing one exercise for each of the six movement types will grow muscles across pretty much the entire body.

These weights are added to what you can currently do to indicate a 10 lb increase in muscle mass. Bone structure is also a factor: short arms are stronger at pushing and weaker for pulling, so could add 10-20 lbs accordingly.

# Body Parts
Bigger body parts: 10-16 sets per week
- Chest
- Back
- Quads
- Glutes (will have some cross-over with quads)
- Hams
- Abs/Calves
Smaller muscle groups: (lots of crossover work) 3-6 sets per week
- Triceps
- Biceps
- Rear delts
- Side delts (in shoulders): training this makes your shoulders wider and makes you look bigger
Training traps and forearms can complement an already good physique

# Exercises
As a beginner, prioritize exercises that involve large muscle masses (generally compound movements, which involve multiple joints); they're generally more effective.
Free weights tend to involve stabilizing muscles more. They're also more difficult to learn for a beginner.

The [best exercises](https://youtu.be/LFhIlZAwjHY?si=XYv1kVfp3zkVgeaf) stimulate muscle growth overtime while accumulating little fatigue. Make sure it doesn't make your joints feel uncomfortable for a long time after trying it for a mesocycle. Look at which has the best stimulus-to-fatigue ratio. Exercises can get stale after a few months, at which point you can switch it up and return to it when it's no longer stale. 

5 exercises for building a solid foundation are [bodyweight squats, push-ups, dumbbell lunges, planks and bent-over rows](https://youtu.be/zDZ6LVxIZws?si=wwomaNQmkJc7PkfD)

## Compound movements
- **Legs.** Squat (quads, glutes), deadlift variation (hams, glutes), hip thrust (glutes).
	Squat is great, but better to combine with other exercises. Squat doesn't hit hams well, but deadlift does. Straight-leg deadlift or Romanian deadlift variation is better for muscle-building than a deadlift from the floor since they involve the hams more. Hip thrust is good for just glutes, as squat hits quads more than glutes—that is, if you're going for glutes, like a lot of women do.
- **Back**. Horizontal pull (rows hit full back), vertical pull (lats).
	Make sure you have two planes of motion pulling for your back. For vertical pulls, pullups are better than lat pulldowns for targeting more musculature. For lat pulldowns, make sure heels are planted; bend back, pull elbows in toward sides when pulling down until it makes light contact with chest, and control negative on the way up. Make sure elbows are pulled to sides, not toward front.
- **Chest**. Horizontal press (DB, BB, machine), DB chest flyes (optional, technically isolation movement)
- **Shoulders**. Vertical press (DB activates the side delt more)
	Super ROM lateral raise (same as lateral raise but keeps going)

## Isolation movements
- **Side delts**. DB Super ROM lateral raise (same as lateral raise but keep going; moderate to high rep count for 10-20 range and control negative slow and well), cross-body cable Y-raise (can hit all fibers evenly)
	Side delts are most important to hit for shoulder volume, rear and front both don't matter as much. 
- **Rear delts**. Reverse pec deck (really reach forward, then sweep out as much as you can, scoot back and lean chest into pad), bent over reverse flye, super ROM reverse cable flye (go past hand connection, alternate which hand goes on top and bottom each set, keep elbows locked out)
	Already targeted to a pretty large degree with horizontal pull for back, so not necessarily required, but only secondary contributor to row.
- **Biceps**. Pick a curl
	Activated in horizontal and vertical pulls, not only secondary in those.
- **Triceps**. Pressdown/extension
	Activated in horizontal and vertical pressing, but not maximally activated. Prefer to include both pressdown and extension.
- **Hamstrings**. Curl
	Deadlifts won't hit one of the four hamstring muscles. Need to do a leg curl to hit it.
- **Calves**. Standing raise (pause at the bottom!)
	At the bottom of every rep, have 1 or 2 second pause to dissipate momentum. If calves are lagging, throw in a seated variation, too; otherwise standing should cover it.
- **Abs**. Crunch and leg raise (6 pack) to target upper and lower abs. Plank and antirotation (obliques and TVA)
	Squats/deadlifts are not good exercises for abs. Crunch is better with resistance like weighted cable crunch or plate-loaded crunch.
