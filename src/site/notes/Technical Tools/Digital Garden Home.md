# Campaign overview
**Schedule:** We meet once a week on Saturday at 6 PM ET, which is Saturday, 6 PM Eastern Time in your local time. Sessions usually last from 3 to 8 hours; averaging maybe 5.5 hours (we typically stop when the session has lasted a few hours already and one of us needs to go).
**Format:** We play by text on FoundryVTT (which needs a decent computer to use). We play live, not PbP.
**System:** D&D 5e
**Setting:** A homebrew high-fantasy world inspired by Forgotten Realms; Arachel can be considered a demiplane in the Forgotten Realms setting.
**Party size:** 5 players
**Requirements/restrictions:** Any experience level welcome. Official content will be allowed and provided. I'll manually approve balanced and appropriate homebrew. Guest stars can play characters stronger/weaker than the players and in any role. If you'd like, I can work with you to create a custom NPC statblock for you to play, instead (I've been told my NPC statblocks are more fun and versatile to play than 5e player characters). Again, you'll need a decent computer to use FoundryVTT.

*House rules, lines, and veils can be found in the `#info` channel on the Arachel Discord.*
# Synopsis: Calling for Demon Babysitters
A massive spire stands over the desolate lands below, stretching into the heavens like an endless arm reaching for the stars. A single window overlooks a barren courtyard where a vulture blissfully feeds on the demons who earned the ire of the demon lord. The light within the tower illuminates the figure of a man by the window; dark hair hangs limply around his face while a pair of leathery wings jut from his back. His gaze remains fixed upon something unseen through that window. There comes a voice from the sword beside himâ€”its whispery voice filled with malice and hate. "*Devour.*"

The echo of the word reverberates throughout the vast chamber before fading away slowly until it disappears altogether. The man looks back down at the blade and says softly, "Soon, my friend. The Abyss consumes more of Arachel for each inch our legions advance. Soon we will have it all."

The man watches as a hellhound silently stalks up to the ignorant vulture in the courtyard below. "With the entire realm trapped in a rapidly shrinking prison, their defeat is only a matter of time."

"*Kill!*" hisses the sword, its voice dripping with eagerness.

"Soon," the man replies calmly. The hellhound stalks closer and closer to the oblivious vulture. "Just like a hellhound to an unsuspecting bird, we will spring our trap on the mortals and the other demon lords. There will be no escape."

The hellhound suddenly lunges forward, tackling the vulture and playfully licking its face. The vulture squawks angrily at having its meal interrupted. It flaps about trying to shoo off the dog, but the hellhound continues to nuzzle the creature with its tail wagging happily.

The man: "..."

The sword: "...*Idiot.*" The echoes reverberate again and again throughout the chamber until it descends into silence once more.

It seems that demon scion Faramin's luck has finally run out. After Faramin's years of comfort and luxury, Demon Lord Artroz has had enough of his lazy, disgraceful, incompetent son and sends him on a journey of self-reflection. However, putting the sinister stepmother in charge of assembling his bodyguards leads to some strange coincidences... all the warriors contracted just so happen to be non-demons fresh from the land of the demons' foes, warriors who would foreseeably kill the insufferably arrogant weakling as soon as he reveals his demonic nature. Still, she overlooked one thing: it's YOU she hired, and you're no simple puppet. All it takes is a simple loophole to uncover a world-shaking possibility. With Demon Lord Artroz offering the only sliver of hope to free you and perhaps even the entire magical land of Arachel from the Abyss, what's babysitting a rotten brat compared to escaping certain doom?
